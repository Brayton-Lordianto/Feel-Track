# Feel-track
An online visualization tool you can count on to travel safely

# Background
Summer vacations are just around the corner, and the hottest thing to do is travel. Ever since the advent of the coronavirus, however, the prevalence of safety from infectious diseases is at its highest. Even today, when borders have opened, the fear of catching such infectious diseases is present. We aim to ease this concern by developing **Feel-Track**. **Feel-Track** allows users to keep track of the rate of infectious illnesses both around them and wherever they want to travel to. When users wish to travel to a place, they can search and obtain information on the illness safety in those areas based on illness scores, and make conscious decisions on where to go.
